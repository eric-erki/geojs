Notably, this class provides the\n * core functionality of {@link geo.osmLayer}, but hooks exist to render\n * tiles more generically.  When multiple zoom levels are present in a given\n * dataset, this class assumes that the space occupied by tile `(i, j)` at\n * level `z` is covered by a 2x2 grid of tiles at zoom level `z + 1`:\n * ```\n *   (2i, 2j),     (2i, 2j + 1)\n *   (2i + 1, 2j), (2i + 1, 2j + 1)\n * ```\n * The higher level tile set should represent a 2x increase in resolution.\n *\n * @class\n * @alias geo.tileLayer\n * @extends geo.featureLayer\n * @param {object?} options\n * @param {number} [options.minLevel=0] The minimum zoom level available.\n * @param {number} [options.maxLevel=18] The maximum zoom level available.\n * @param {object} [options.tileOverlap] Pixel overlap between tiles.\n * @param {number} [options.tileOverlap.x] Horizontal overlap.\n * @param {number} [options.tileOverlap.y] Vertical overlap.\n * @param {number} [options.tileWidth=256] The tile width without overlap.\n * @param {number} [options.tileHeight=256] The tile height without overlap.\n * @param {function} [options.tilesAtZoom=null] A function that is given a\n *    zoom level and returns `{x: (num), y: (num)}` with the number of tiles\n *    at that zoom level.\n * @param {number} [options.cacheSize=400] The maximum number of tiles to\n *    cache.  The default is 200 if keepLower is false.\n * @param {boolean} [options.keepLower=true] When truthy, keep lower zoom\n *    level tiles when showing high zoom level tiles.  This uses more memory\n *    but results in smoother transitions.\n * @param {boolean} [options.wrapX=true] Wrap in the x-direction.\n * @param {boolean} [options.wrapY=false] Wrap in the y-direction.\n * @param {string|function} [options.url=null] A function taking the current\n *   tile indices `(x, y, level, subdomains)` and returning a URL or jquery\n *   ajax config to be passed to the {geo.tile} constructor.  Example:\n *   ```\n *   (x, y, z, subdomains) => \"http://example.com/z/y/x.png\"\n *   ```\n *   If this is a string, a template url with {x}, {y}, {z}, and {s} as\n *   template variables.  {s} picks one of the subdomains parameter and may\n *   contain a comma-separated list of subdomains.\n * @param {string|list} [options.subdomain=\"abc\"] Subdomains to use in\n *   template url strings.  If a string, this is converted to a list before\n *   being passed to a url function.\n * @param {string} [options.baseUrl=null]  If defined, use the old-style base\n *   url instead of the options.url parameter.  This is functionally the same\n *   as using a url of `baseUrl/{z}/{x}/{y}.(options.imageFormat || png)`.\n *   If the specified string does not end in a slash, one is added.\n * @param {string} [options.imageFormat='png'] This is only used if a\n *   `baseUrl` is specified, in which case it determines the image name\n *   extension used in the url.\n * @param {number} [options.animationDuration=0] The number of milliseconds\n *   for the tile loading animation to occur.  Only some renderers support\n *   this.\n * @param {string} [options.attribution] An attribution to display with the\n *   layer (accepts HTML).\n * @param {function} [options.tileRounding=Math.round] This function\n *   determines which tiles will be loaded when the map is at a non-integer\n *   zoom.  For example, `Math.floor`, will use tile level 2 when the map is\n *   at zoom 2.9.\n * @param {function} [options.tileOffset] This function takes a zoom level\n *   argument and returns, in units of pixels, the coordinates of the point\n *   (0, 0) at the given zoom level relative to the bottom left corner of the\n *   domain.\n * @param {function} [options.tilesMaxBounds=null] This function takes a zoom\n *   level argument and returns an object with `x` and `y` in pixels which is\n *   used to crop the last row and column of tiles.  Note that if tiles wrap,\n *   only complete tiles in the wrapping direction(s) are supported, and this\n *   max bounds will probably not behave properly.\n * @param {boolean} [options.topDown=false]  True if the gcs is top-down,\n *   false if bottom-up (the ingcs does not matter, only the gcs coordinate\n *   system).  When falsy, this inverts the gcs y-coordinate when calculating\n *   local coordinates.\n * @returns {geo.tileLayer}\n */\nvar tileLayer = function (options) {\n  'use strict';\n  if (!(this instanceof tileLayer)) {\n    return new tileLayer(options);\n  }\n  featureLayer.call(this, options);\n\n  var $ = require('jquery');\n  var geo_event = require('./event');\n  var transform = require('./transform');\n  var tileCache = require('./tileCache');\n  var fetchQueue = require('./fetchQueue');\n  var adjustLayerForRenderer = require('./registry').adjustLayerForRenderer;\n  var Tile = require('./tile');\n\n  options = $.extend(true, {}, this.constructor.defaults, options || {});\n  if (!options.cacheSize) {\n    // this size should be sufficient for a 4k display\n    options.cacheSize = options.keepLower ? 600 : 200;\n  }\n  if ($.type(options.subdomains) === 'string') {\n    options.subdomains = options.subdomains.split('');\n  }\n  /* We used to call the url option baseUrl.
